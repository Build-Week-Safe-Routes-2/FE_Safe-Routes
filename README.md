## PITCH

- What are the most dangerous intersections in the state? With this app users have the ability to avoid the most dangerous intersections in a given area.

- Disclaimer: Are you hungry to learn new things and looking to create a story of how you overcame a challenge? Web students that select this project will have to learn how to use an API or Libraries for the map part of this project.

## MVP

#### Web:

- Address / Intersection input field
- Interactive Map showing crash statistic for a given intersection
- Show historical crashes on the map for given time period
- Visualization should indicate the likelihood of crashes at different locations
- MVP should have a limited geographic scope

## STRETCH

#### Web:

- Ask user to use their location, if available.
- Expand geographic scope of the map
